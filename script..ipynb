      "I've supported Anker products for 8 or 9 years now. I started buying their flashlights and nightlights years ago when my children were small, because they were well built and fair priced, so I began buying their other products as well, but never anything really expensive. I decided to give these headphones a try, rather than a more expensive name brand and was pleasantly surprised by their sound quality and noise cancelling ability. That is, until I wasn't. The right earphone began demonstrating a static sound that sounded almost like a radio station that doesn't have anything playing on it. It was even worse if you touched the earphone or moved/tilted your head. Obviously something inside of the earphone failed, so being what I thought was a great company, I looked up Ankers warranty, which was 18 months. I thought, great! Now when did I buy these? As it turned out, my warranty expired literally 14 days before I contacted them about the issue. Again, I thought, \"Surely they'll stand behind their product over a mere 14 days.\" I was 100% wrong. I sent them a courteous email explaining the issue and informing them that I knew my warranty had expired 14 days earlier, but hopefully they would still honor it since it was so close. They responded with an apology, but also stated there was nothing they could do because the warranty had expired. They also attached a link for me to escalate the issue if I desired, so I did. I sent them all of my order information showing my purchase date, serial and model numbers, etc. and pleaded with them to not let 14 days become the deciding factor as to whether I would be a lifelong supporter of their products or decide that I would never purchase or endorse any of their products to anyone, ever again. I received a similar response again. They stated that they would like to help me out and wanted me to continue supporting them, but again, there was nothing they could do because the warranty expired 2 weeks earlier. They then proceeded to offer me a 15% off coupon if I purchased another product of theirs. No thanks, Anker. My decision was made at that point about the type of company it is and while I'm very aware that my warranty expired, I'm also aware that this wasn't a 30 day warranty or something similar where I'm writing them 6 months after the fact. It's an 18 month warranty, where the issue began before the warranty expired, but due to other obligations, I was unable to email them until after the fact and I assumed they would take such a short amount of time into consideration, but I was wrong. If they do decide to show me they're an above average company, I'll update this review, but after 2 emails informing me they \"are unable to do anything\", I'm not holding my breath. Best of luck to everyone else. Maybe you'll have better luck than I did with them.\n",
